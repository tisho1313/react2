## Support for [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/)

The Azure Static Web Apps extension supports running on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/) and [github.dev](http://github.dev/). Open a GitHub repository to create and update Static Web Apps directly from your browser! Debugging is not supported on the web. Note that this does not require the Azure Account extension and uses VS Code's built-in authentication provider.

## Run and debug your static web app

âœ¨ Check out [Guide: Debugging a Static Web App with VS Code](https://aka.ms/setupSwaCliCode) for instructions and more information about debugging a static web app.

## Create your first static web app

1. Click the '+' button in the explorer to setup a new static web app

    ![Create Static Web App](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-azurestaticwebapps/raw/main/resources/readme/create_resource.png)

1. Select "Create Static Web App..."

1. Select a repository and branch that will be deployed to the static web app
    > If your local project has a remote configured, the extension will default to that repository
1. Provide the app folder name
    > Location of your application code. For example, '/' represents the root of your app, while '/app' represents a directory called 'app'.
1. Provide the api folder name (optional)
    > Location of your Azure Functions code. For example, '/api' represents a folder called 'api'. If you don't have an Azure Functions project yet, don't worry!  This is optional so just leave this blank.
1. Provide the build artifact folder name
    > The path of your build output relative to your apps location. For example, setting a value of 'build' when your app location is set to '/app' will cause the content at '/app/build' to be served.

## Updating your static web app

Commit and push your changes to the GitHub repository that your static web app is configured to.  It will then use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to update your app.

If you create a pull request through GitHub, GitHub Actions will create a staging environment with your new changes live.  Your Production environment and staging environments are all listed within your Static Web App as well as application settings.

> **IMPORTANT:** The application settings only apply to the backend API of an Azure Static Web App.

## Create a HTTP Function for your static web app

You can add a serverless API to your static web app by creating a HTTP Functions project.

1. Open your static web app project in your Visual Studio Code workspace
1. Select the button to create a new HTTP Function

    ![Create HTTP Function](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-azurestaticwebapps/raw/main/resources/readme/create_http_function.png)

1. Provide a HTTP Function name that is unique to your API
1. If this is your first HTTP Function, select a language for your API
